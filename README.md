## Description

This is a full stack web app. From HTL, CSS, Jquery to Node.js, Express, JAWSDB and Heroku

## Development

Created the MVC structure first and worked upon each element required, starting from the node.js, using terminal and running ``npm i``, installing all the required dependencies, and started by creating the schema.sql and seeds.sql, preparing the database, credentials and being able to connect to it
